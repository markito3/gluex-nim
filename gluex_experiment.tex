\section[The \gx{} experiment (Curtis)]{\label{sec:gluexexperiment} The \gx{} experiment}
The search for QCD exotics has been on going for several decades and utilizing data from a wide range of experiments and production mechanisms. Historically, such searches have looked for gluonic excitations of mesons, looking for both states of pure glue, glueballs, and those where the gluonic field binding the quark-anti-quark pair has been excited, hybrid mesons. Reviews of searches for glueballs~\cite{Crede:2008vw} show that most of these looked for so-called scalar glueballs, where the searches rely on over population of nonets as well as unusual decay patterns of the states. In the search for hybrid mesons~\cite{Meyer:2010ku,Meyer:2015eta}, searches have focused on states with non-quark-anti-quark (exotic) quantum numbers and good evidence exists for an isospin $1$ state, the $\pi_{1}(1600)$. Looking collectively at the past work, data from high-statistics photoproduction experiments in the relevant energy regime is lacking in these studies.

The \gx{} experiment at Jefferson Lab has been built to both search for, and map out the spectrum of exotic hybrid mesons using a high-energy (9~GeV) linearly-polarized photon beam incident on a proton target\cite{gluex-ref}. The detector is nearly hermetic for both charged particles and photons, allowing for reconstruction of exclusive final states. A 2~T solenoidal magnet surrounds the drift-chamber based tracking. Two electromagnetic calorimeters cover the central and forward regions, and a down stream time-of-flight detector is provide particle identification capability through flight time measurements. The \gx{} detector and beamline is shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:gluex_cut-away}.


\subsection[The Hall D complex]{The Hall D complex \label{sec:gluexexperiment:complex}}
The \gx{} experiment is housed in the Hall D complex at Jefferson Lab. This new construction starts with an extracted electron beam at the north end of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). These are the highest-energy electrons at the lab, up to 12~GeV, due to the extra one-half pass of acceleration they have relative to the other experimental areas. The electron beam enters the tagger hall where it is used to produce linearly polarized photons through coherent bremsstrahlung~\cite{} on a 50~$\mu$m thick diamond crystal radiator. The scattered electrons pass through a tagger magnet and are bent into tagging detectors. A high-resolution array consisting of scintillating fibers covering the 8 to 9~GeV energy range, and a tagger hodoscope covering photon energies both from 9~GeV to the endpoint, and down from 8~GeV to 3~GeV. Those electrons not interacting in the diamond and bent into a beam dump. The tagged photons pass through a 75~m long tunnel to the Hall-D expreimental hall. The first pass through a 5~mm diameter collimator which removes the off-axis incoherent photons. The from face of the collimator is instrumented with an active collimator to aid in beam tuning. 

Downstream of the collimator is a thin beryllium radiator used by both the triplet polarimeter which measures the linear polarization of the photons and a pair spectrometer which is used to measure the flux of the photons. More information on the production, tagging and monitoring of the photon beam can be found in Section~\ref{sec:chap:beam}. The photons then pass through a 30~cm long liquid hydrogen target at the heart of the \gx{} detector. Photons which did not interact in the target travel to the end of the experimental hall where they enter the photon beam dump.

The \gx{} detector is based on a 4~m long solenoidal magnet which is operated at a maximum field of 2~T. More information on the solenoid is in Section~\ref{sec:solenoid}. The liquid hydrogen target is located 65~cm from the upstream bore of the magnet. It consists of a 4~cm diameter, 30~cm long volume of hydrogen and is described in Section~\ref{sec:target}. Surrounding the target is the start counter which consists of 30 thin scintilator paddles that bend to a nose on the down-stream end of the target. The start counter is used identify the radio-frequency (RF) bunch from which the primary electron came. More information can be found in Section~\ref{sec:scintillators}. 

Starting at a radius of 8~cm from the beamline is the central drift chamber, a cylindrical straw-tube detector. The active volume of the chamber extends from 65~cm upstream to 85~cm down-stream of the target center, and from 8~cm to 30~cm in radius. It consists of 28 layers of straw tubes in axial and two stereo orientations. Down-stream of the central tracker is the forward drift chamber. This device consists of four packages, each containing 6 planar layers in alternating $u$-$y$-$v$ orientations. Both cathodes and anodes are readout from the forward chambers, providing 3D space point measurements. More details on the tracking system can be found in Section~\ref{sec:tracking}. 

Downstream of the magnet is a time-of-flight wall. The detector consists of two layers of scintilator paddles in a crossed pattern, and in conjunction with the start counter, is used to measure the flight-time of charged particles. More information can be found in Section~\ref{sec:scintillators}. 
Photons in \gx{} are detected in two calorimeter systems. The barrel calorimeter, located inside the solenoid, consists if layers of scintillating fiber alternating with lead sheets. The forward calorimeter is downstream of the time-of-flight wall, and consists of $2800$ lead-glass blocks. More information can be found in Section~\ref{sec:calorimeters}.

\subsection[Experimental Requirements]{Experimental Requirements \label{sec:intro:requirements}}
In order to be able to exclusively reconstruct events with final states given in Table~\ref{tab:exotic_modes},
accurate reconstruction of the incident photon, as well as the produced charge particles and photons
is necessary. 

The linear polarization of the incident photon beam is produced through the coherent 
bremsstrahlung process. These coherent photons have energies in the range of 8.4 to 9~GeV,
and will be about $40\%$, after the beam collimation to $\sim{}25~\mu$rad with respect to the incoming 
electron direction. For these linearly-polarized photons, it is necessary to accurately know the photon 
energy, both for the exclusive final state reconstruction and also to accurately determine the photon 
polarization on an event-by-event basis. In \GX{}, this energy is known to an accuracy of $0.1\%$ of the
incident photon energy.

In order to exclusively reconstruct multi-particle final states, the \GX{} detector needs be nearly
hermetic with good momentum and energy resolution for both charged particles and photons.
In order to be able to carry out the needed amplitude analysis, the detector acceptance  needs to 
be reasonably uniform, and well understood and modeled in simulation. Typical momentum resolution
for charged particles $1$--$2\%$, while for very-forward high-momentum particles, it is somewhat
worse at around $8$-$9\%$. For high-momentum charged particles, the tracking system has 
nearly hermetic acceptance for polar angles from about $2^{\circ}$ to $150^{\circ}$ in the lab. 
Because of target material, protons with momentum below about 350~MeV/c are not detected,
and pions with momentum under 200~MeV/c can have spiraling trajectories in the detector,
which make reconstruction challenging.

For photons, the typical energy resolution is $(5\,\mathrm{to}\,6\%)/\sqrt{E_{\gamma}}$. There is some 
variation in the barrel calorimeter resolution, depending on the incident angle of the photon,
but generally, photons above about 50~MeV are detected in the BCAL. The interaction point
along the beam direction is determined by comparing the information from the readouts on the 
upstream and downstream ends of the detector. The forward calorimeter can reconstruct photons
whose energy is larger than 100~MeV, with uniform resolution across the face of the detector.
There is an overlap region between the calorimeters at around $11^{\circ}$. Both photon detection 
efficiency and energy resolution is degraded in this region. 
 
\subsection{Data Requirements \label{sec:intro:data_requirements}}
In addition to the ability to reconstruct exclusive final states, the \GX{} experiment
will need to collect sufficient statistics to carry out amplitude analyses in small bins 
of meson invariant mass, and in momentum transfer, $|t|$. Large production cross
sections for reactions of interest are 10~$\mu$b, while more typical final-state 
cross sections are a few hundred nb. The \GX{} experiment has been built with a 
data acquisition system capable of collecting data using photon beams with $10^{8}~\gamma/$s
in the coherent peak. However, the experiment may be limited by electromagnetic backgrounds
in the detector, and force to run at photon  rates smaller than the design limit.

Expected raw event sizes are $15$kilobytes, and the data acquisition limit is expected to 
be 20~kHz. The level-1 hardware trigger alone will allow the experiment to run 
at in incident photon rate of $10^{7}~\gamma/$s in the coherent peak. Of the 20~kHz
event rate, about 2~kHz corresponds to hadronic interaction with photon in the coherent
peak. In order to run at higher beam intensities, the level-3 software trigger is needed to 
keep the rate of events to tape limited to 20~kHz. Including the events where the energy
of the interacting photon is above 9~GeV roughly doubles the number of interesting hadronic
events. 

The typical final states listed in Table~\ref{tab:exotic_modes} are expected to range from $3.5\%$ 
of the hadronic events for $\gamma p \rightarrow p 3\pi$ to under $1\%$. Assuming an $85\%$
reconstruction efficiency per final state particle, and that $60\%$ of the final state protons
are detectable, Table~\ref{tab:decay_rate_fractions} shows the number of reconstructed events per
hour assuming a total hadronic rate of 2~kHz for events with photon energies in the coherent
peak. These events are ultimately binned in both an meson invariant mass, as well as momentum
transfer, $|t|$, but for most of these channels $40$ days of running at $50\%$ efficiency would 
produce about a factor of $500$ times the number listed in the table.This is sufficient for
an initial amplitude analysis on many of these channels. Phase IV running of \GX{} anticipates 
$200$ days of running with $5\times  10^{7}$ photon beam intensity, a factor of $25$ over the
above estimate.

\subsection[Detector]{Detector \label{sec:detector}}
The design of the GlueX detector \cite{Ghoul:2015ifw} is based on a solenoidal magnet that surrounds all detectors in the central region, providing a magnetic field of about $2$~T along the direction of the photon beam, which impinges on a 
$30$~cm-long liquid hydrogen target.  A schematic of the detector including its major sub-detectors is given in Fig.\,\ref{fig:gluexsketch}.
