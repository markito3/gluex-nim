\label{fig:beam:cebaf-dwg} 
\end{figure}

The CEBAF schematics is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:cebaf-dwg}.
Parallel operations of up to three halls including Hall D are provided
with the help of a 750~MHz RF separator. Each hall receives a 250~MHz
electron beam. The beam to halls A-C can be extracted after 1-5 passes
around the accelerator. The beam to Hall D is extracted magnetically
after 5.5 passes. The beam line carries the beam to the Tagger Hall,
4.7~m higher than the level of the accelerator.  The nominal beam
energy at 5.5 passes is about 12~GeV. The exact energy is optimized
considering the requirements for the longitudinal beam polarization in
the halls A-C.

The Hall D complex is shown in Fig.\,ref{fig:beam:schematic}. More details can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:halld-tot}), which shows the Tagger
Hall, the Collimator Cave and Hall D itself. The broad-band photon
beam is produced in the Tagger Hall.

\end{figure}

The electron beam passes through a thin radiator. Downstream of the
radiator, the electrons are deflected by a dipole magnet. The
electrons that lost a small amount of energy to bremsstrahlung in the
radiator are deflected by 13.4$^\circ$ into the electron beam dump.
The electrons that lost more than 25\% of the initial energy are
deflected into an array of scintillation counters, which allow to
measure the electron's energy and to calculate the energy of the
radiated photon. The magnet and the counters comprise the ``tagging
system''. A permanent, 0.8~T$\cdot$m dipole magnet is located
downstream of the tagger magnet on the photon beam line, preventing
the electron beam to reach Hall D in case the tagger magnet trips.

A properly aligned thin diamond crystal radiator produces both the
incoherent and coherent bremsstrahlung. The coherent radiation is
concentrated at small angles $<$25~$\mu$rad with respect to the beam
direction, while the incoherent radiation has a broader angular
distribution.  The coherent radiation is peaked at certain energies
and is linearly polarized, depending on the crystal orientation with
respect to the beam. The degree of linear polarization in the coherent
peak is higher at lower peak energies. In the Collimator Cave, about
80~m downstream of the radiator, the photon beam is collimated in
order to increase the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized photons.  In
the nominal \GX{} configuration, we produce the main coherent peak
with maximum energy of 9~GeV, and use a $\diameter$=3.4~mm collimator.
The expected degree of linear polarization in the energy range of
8.4--9.0~GeV is $\sim$40\% after collimation. The beam energy spectrum
after collimation and the photon flux are measured by the Pair
Spectrometer, located in Hall D. The beam polarization can be derived
from the shape of the spectrum. Independently, the beam polarization
can be directly measured by the triple polarimeter upstream of the
Pair Spectrometer.

Finally, the photon beam travels through the \GX{} detector, and
ultimately goes to the photon beam dump just outside the downstream
end of the experimental hall.

\subsection[Pair spectrometer (TCR)]{Pair spectrometer \label{sec:ps}}

The Pair Spectrometer is located at the entrance to Hall D
(Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:hall-d}).  The spectrometer reconstructs the
energy of a beam photon by detecting the $e^\pm$ pair produced by the
photon in a thin converter. The main purpose of the spectrometer is to
measure the spectrum of the collimated photon beam and determine the
fraction of linearly polarized photons in the coherent peak energy
region. It will also monitor the photon beam flux and can be used for
the energy calibration of the tagging hodoscope and microscope
detectors.

% --------------------------------------------

Electron-positron pairs are created by beam photons inside a thin
converter with a typical thickness ranging between 0.03\% and 0.5\% of
a radiation length. The choice of the converter thickness depends on
the photon beam flux. The maximum photon flux for GlueX physics runs
is expected to be 50~MHz in the coherent peak energy region. Three
converters with different thicknesses are installed in a movable fork
that can insert one of them into the photon beam. Produced leptons are
deflected in a 18D36 dipole magnet with an effective field length of
about 0.94~m. The magnet was brought from Brookhaven National
Laboratory and was modified at Jefferson Lab by reducing the pole gap
from 6 inches to 3 inches. The magnet is operated at a nominal field
of 1.8~T; the field integral is $\int{}Bdl\approx$1.60~T\,m. The beam
angular spread is $<0.04$~mrad, and the angular spread of the pair
production is $\sim{}\gamma^{-1}<0.2$~mrad. The multiple scattering at
3~GeV in the thickest converter adds about 0.3~mrad. The particle
deflection by the magnet at the momentum $p$ is
$\theta{}=0.3\,[\mathrm{GeV/c/T/m}]\int{}Bdl/p$;
$\theta\approx{}80~\mathrm{mrad}=4.6^\circ$ at 6~GeV.  
A 1.5~m long
vacuum chamber is installed after the magnet. Electrons and positrons
are registered in two layers of scintillator detectors: a
high-granularity hodoscope and a set of coarse counters, denoted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-layout} as PS and PSC, respectively. The
detectors are organized into two arms positioned symmetrically with
respect to the photon beam line.  Each detector arm covers a momentum
range of $e^\pm$ between 3.0 GeV/c and 6.2 GeV/c, corresponding to
reconstructed photon energies between 6~GeV and 12.4~GeV. Relatively
large acceptance of the hodoscope allows one to reconstruct photons
with energies in the coherent peak energy region and also in the range
near the beam end-point energy of 12~GeV. This can be used for the
energy calibration of the hodoscope detectors.

\subsubsection[PS: High Resolution Detector]{PS: High Resolution Detector
  \label{sec:beamline:ps-hresol}
}

Each arm of the high resolution detector consists of 145 rectangular
tiles made of EJ-212 scintillator~\footnote{
  ELJEN Technology Plastic Scintillators \url{http://www.eljentechnology.com}. 
}, stacked together as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-tiles}. The tile height is 3 cm and the
length along the particle path in scintillator is 1 cm. Out of 145 tiles,
40 tiles close to the beam are 1~mm thick, the rest are 2~mm thick.
 The momentum
bin size of the tile depends on the electron/positron energy as 
$\Delta{}p=\Delta{}x/x\cdot{}p$ 
and constitutes about 13~MeV/c for 3~GeV and 24~MeV/c for 6~GeV particles.
Tiles are optically isolated using 10~$\mu$m
aluminized Mylar foil. This reflective foil also covers the bottom of
the tile assembly. In order to keep the tiles parallel to the
particle trajectories, the tiles are organized into 18 groups. Each
group is tilted by $\sim$0.005~mrad using 0.05~mm thick shims
(adhesive strips) positioned between the adjacent groups. The 
first group is tilted by about 80~mrad, so that the tiles are parallel
the 6~GeV particle trajectories.

Light from a tile is collected using two 20~cm long 2$\times$2~mm$^2$
double-clad BCF-92 wave-length shifting (WLS) fibers,
glued to the sides of the tile using BC 600 Optical Cement. A tile
assembly with two WLS optical fibers is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-tiles}. The peak of the emission spectrum for EJ-212
scintillator occurs at the wavelength of 423 nm, which couples well
with the absorption spectrum of the BCF-92 fiber. Light is
subsequently re-emitted inside the fiber in the green range with an
emission peak of 492 nm.

Collected light is transmitted to the end of the WLS fiber. A pair of
fibers from each tile is inserted into a hole in an aluminum mounting
plate. %, as shown on the upper plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:hodoscope}. 
The light detection is performed using Hamamatsu
surface mount S10931-050P silicon photomultipliers with an effective
photosensitive area of 3$\times$3~mm$^2$ and a pixel size of 0.05$\times$0.05~mm$^2$.
These sensors have a photon detection efficiency (PDE) larger
than 20\% at a wavelength of 500~nm and a typical gain of about
$7\cdot{}10^5$~\footnote{
 Hamamatsu Corporation, MPPC S10931-050P, 
 \url{http://www.electronicsdatasheets.com/pdf-datasheets/hamamatsu/s10931050p}.
}.
Each photo sensor is coupled to two WLS fibers
from a single tile.
The electronics board (Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-electr-assemb} left) 
with 145 SiPMs is attached
to the mounting plate.
The SiPMs are arranged in two arrays
of 3$\times$35 and 5$\times$8 sensors, which are connected to 2~mm and~1 mm
tiles, respectively. SiPMs are optically isolated using a plastic
spacer.

\subsubsection[PSC: Coarse Resolution Detector]{PSC: Coarse Resolution Detector
  \label{sec:beamline:ps-coarse} }


Sixteen coarse scintillator counters, eight in each detector arm, are
positioned about 40~cm behind the hodoscope.  The counters are 4.4~cm
wide in the direction perpendicular to the particle trajectory, 2~cm
thick, and 6~cm in height.  Hamamatsu R6427-01 PMTs are used to detect
the scintillation light. The counters are used to produce a pair
spectrometer trigger by requiring a coincidence of hits in the two
detector arms. They also help to reduce background originating from
interactions of $e^\pm$ inside the magnet pole edges to the level
below 1\% by constraining the $e^\pm$ trajectories.  Counter rates
depend on the converter thickness and photon beam flux. The maximum
rate will not exceed 10~kHz per PSC counter during GlueX operation.


\subsubsection[Electronics]{Electronics
  \label{sec:beamline:ps-electronics}
}

The PS hodoscope front end electronics consists of an amplifier and a
SiPM bias voltage control circuit developed at Jefferson Lab. Signals
from the SiPMs are amplified using the amplifier with a gain of about
a factor of 20.  The amplifier is based on commercially available
devices (operational amplifiers) with 3~GHz bandwidth.  Pulse shaping
is employed to compensate for the characteristically high SiPM
capacitance and package inductance. The impulse response shows rise
and fall times of 3~ns and with trans-impedance gain of 1~mV/$\mu$A.  
The SiPM operating bias voltage is about 73~V. The
nominal bias setting is as specified by Hamamatsu (1~V over voltage)
and fed to the SiPM through a resistive network employing a thermistor
and a linearizing resistor. The hodoscope control electronics supply
individually adjusted voltages to groups of 5 SiPM channels; inside
the group the voltage is adjusted among channels using resistors. The
thermistor senses the average temperature of closely packed SiPMs in
thermal equilibrium via a heat spreader PCB layout, thus forming a
well controlled loop. 
%The commercially available bias power supply has
%very low noise characteristics and is well regulated to less than 1~mV
%long term. The supply allows the user to monitor and adjust the levels
%as needed and if required. The optimal bias setting will be determined
%based on experimental conditions.

Signals from both the hodoscope and coarse counters are digitized
using a twelve-bit multi-channel flash ADC operated at a sampling rate
of 250~MHz (fADC250-MHz). The PSC counters are also instrumented with
TDCs, with the intrinsic resolution of $\sim$60~ps.  The timing resolution
is expected to be better than 200~ps. 

An example of the fADC signal pulse obtained from a PS scintillator
tile is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-signals} (left).  The ADC
sampling time is 4~ns. The SiPMs allow to resolve the number of pixels
fired, demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-signals} (right). The
average amplitudes of the signals in the Pair Spectrometer correspond
to about 60 pixels fired.

%This resolution will allow one
%to distinguish the electron beam bunch where the bremsstrahlung photon
%is emitted and therefore relate hits from the pair spectrometer and
%tagging detectors originating from the same event.

\subsection[Target (TCR)]{Target \label{sec:target} (TCR)}
The Hall D cryotarget is a small kapton target cell containing liquid
hydrogen (LH$_2$) or liquid deuterium (LD$_2$) at a temperature and pressure
of about 18~$^\circ$K and 18~psia. The cell, which is closely modeled on those
utilized in Hall B for more than a decade, is a horizontal, tapered
cylinder about 400~mm long with a mean diameter of 20~mm.  Liquid
hydrogen is introduced into the cell using a pair of 1.5~m long
stainless steel tubes (fill and return) connected to a small, copper
vessel where hydrogen gas is condensed.  This condenser is cooled by a
pulse tube refrigerator%
\footnote{Cryomech Model PT415}
(PTR) with a base temperature of 3~$^\circ$K and
cooling power of about 20~W at 20~$^\circ$K.  
A 100~W temperature controller%
\footnote{Lake Shore Model 336}
regulates the condenser's temperature.

The entire target assembly is contained in an ``L''-shaped,
stainless steel and aluminum vacuum chamber with a Rohacell extension
surrounding the target cell.  The vacuum chamber, along with the
hydrogen storage tanks, gas handling system, and control electronics,
is mounted on a custom-built beamline cart for insertion into the Hall
D solenoid.  A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) monitors and
controls the performance of the target, while hardware interlocks on
the target temperature and pressure and on the chamber vacuum ensure
the system's safety and integrity.

A simplified schematic drawing of the target system is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:tgt:scheme}, and a scale drawing of the target, 
with the insertion cart, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tgt:pict}.

\subsubsection[Target Cell]{Target Cell \label{sec:tgt:cell}}

A detailed drawing of the target cell is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tgt:cell}.  The cell is 5~mil (0.13~mm), alum-inized
polyimide (Kapton) foil wrapped into a tapered cylinder and glued
along one edge.  An extruded Kapton exit window is glued to the
downstream end, and the upstream end is glued into an aluminum base.
A polyimide-amide (torlon) tube is glued into the aluminum base and
acts as a re-entrant window frame for a Kapton beam-entrance window.
Stainless steel tubes for liquid hydrogen (fill and return) are also
glued into the base.  The epoxy%
\footnote{3M Scotch-Weld DP-190 (gray)}
used for all
glued joints has a long and successful track record for cryogenic use
at Jefferson Lab.  Two calibrated Cernox4 thermometers will be
inserted into the cell to determine the temperature with better than
0.5\% accuracy.

Prototypes for these cells have been constructed and pressurized to
failure at room temperature.  The burst pressure is typically around
200~psia. Based on the results of pull tests performed at 77~$^\circ$K, the
burst pressure of the cell at 18~$^\circ$K will be significantly higher than
at room temperature.  However we do take credit for this in our
pressure relief analysis.  The operational pressure of the cell is
about 35~psia at room temperature and about 18~psia when filled with
LH$_2$. Redundant pressure relief valves, along with properly sized
system plumbing, ensure that the cell pressure never exceeds 45~psia.
All relief paths, including one on the vacuum chamber as well as all
pump exhausts are directed to a dedicated hydrogen vent line installed
in Hall D.  This line terminates outside the hall and is continuously
purged with an inert gas (nitrogen) to ensure that a flammable
hydrogen/oxygen mixture does not exist inside the line.

\subsubsection[Condensation of Hydrogen Gas]{Condensation of Hydrogen Gas 
\label{sec:tgt:condens}}

Room temperature hydrogen gas is introduced to the target from a pair
of 55-gallon (208~$\ell$) storage tanks located on the insertion cart
and charged with an initial H$_2$ pressure of approximately 35~psia (2.3
atm).  The gas is first cooled to approximately 80~$^\circ$K by a copper heat
exchanger in thermal contact with the first stage of the pulse tube
refrigerator (PTR).  The first stage of the PTR is also used to cool a
copper heat shield that surrounds the condenser and the fill and
return tubes to the target cell.  The shield does not extend to the
cell itself, which is instead wrapped with ten layers of
superinsulation.
