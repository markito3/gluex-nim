\section[The beam line and coherent photon source (Stuart)]{The beam line and coherent photon source \label{sec:beamline}}
{\color{red}General comment: As we haggle in the beamline group over the level of detail required for this section, it is worth bearing in mind that a longer-form paper dedicated to the beamline is also on our to-do list.  Material and detail felt to be excessive for this document can spill over into that paper}

The Hall D complex has been described in Section \ref{sec:gluexexperiment:complex} and is shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:Draw_beamline}, which shows the Tagger Hall, the collimator cave and Hall D itself. The CEBAF electron beam enters the Tagger Hall with properties listed in Table\,\ref{tab:elecprop}. The position at the radiator is monitored and
controlled using beam position monitors\footnote{Named 5C11 and 5C11B, positions indicated in Figure \ref{fig:beam:Draw_beamline}} located at the end of the accelerator tunnel just upstream of the Tagger Hall. The position of the beam on the collimator
is initially set by adjusting small corrector magnets at this location. The electron spot size at the radiator is relatively large and converges to a virtual focus located at the collimator 75\,m away. The virtual spot size ($\sim$ 0.5\,mm) is small compared to the intrinsic size of the photon beam on the face of the collimator. The position on the collimator is monitored using the response of the active collimator to the incident photon beam. The stability of the beam is maintained during production by a feedback system that fixes the position of the beam at the monitor and at the active collimator. The energy and stability of the electron beam can be monitored using an additional beam position monitor, located immediately upstream of the electron dump.

The photon beam is produced in the Tagger Hall, which is described in more detail in Section\,\ref{sec:tag}.
A properly aligned thin diamond crystal radiator produces linearly polarized photons via coherent bremsstrahlung \cite{timm1969,LIVINGSTON2009205} in addition to photons due to incoherent scattering.
The coherent radiation is peaked at certain energies and is linearly polarized, depending on the crystal orientation with respect to the beam.
The degree of linear polarization in the coherent peak is higher at lower peak photon energies.
In order to increase the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized photons, the photon beam is collimated.  In the nominal \GX{} configuration, we produce the main coherent peak
with maximum energy of 9\,GeV and use a 5.0\,mm collimator.\footnote{A 3.4~mm collimator is also available, and has been used for some physics production runs.}
The beam energy spectrum after collimation and the photon flux are measured by the Pair
Spectrometer, located in Hall D. The photon spectrum and its polarization with a 12\,GeV electron beam are shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:beam:gx3102_pi0etaAsym2016_fig0_beam}.
The expected degree of linear polarization in the energy range of 8.4--9.0~GeV is $\sim$40\% after collimation. 
The beam polarization is directly measured by the triplet polarimeter upstream of the pair spectrometer. The polarization can also be tracked using various physics channels, such as $\rho$ production {\color{red}(Stuart: We should have a reference for this technique, or a short write-up as a subsection of \ref{sec:polarization}.  What about Analytic Bremsstrahlung fitting? Was this technique ever used in Gluex, even only for polarization monitoring?)}, even if they cannot determine the absolute value of the polarization. 
{\color{red} Comment by Elton: Somewhere we should add a (typical) plot of the measured convergence of the beam onto the collimator. Do we want add a figure with our harp scan? Perhaps here or maybe in a section below.}

In the sections that follow, we describe how the linearly polarized photon beam is produced, how its energy is determined using the tagging spectrometer, how its polarization is determined in the triplet polarimeter, how the flux is monitored with the pair spectrometer, and how the flux is calibrated using the total absorption counter.
The photon is dumped in the photon beam dump just outside the downstream end of the experimental hall.
The main parameters and properties of the photon beam are given in Table\,\ref{tab:operates}.

\subsection{Goniometer and Radiators \label{sec:radiators}}
The goniometer\footnote{Manufactured by Newport Corporation} is a device which can position and precisely move horizontally, vertically and rotationally about the x, y and z axes.
The Hall D goniometer holds several radiators, each used depending on the requirements of the experiment.

For the linearly polarized photon beams normally used in \GX{} production running, diamond radiators, typically 50 $\mu m$ thick, are used in the coherent bremsstrahlung technique.
This technique requires precise alignment of a diamond radiator, in order to produce a highly polarized beam by scattering off the appropriate crystal planes associated with a particular reciprocal lattice vector.

Several thin aluminium radiators, of varying thickness between 1.5 $\mu m$ and 30 $\mu m$\footnote{$2\times10^{-5}$ to $3\times10^{-4}$ radiation lengths}, are installed on the goniometer and a separate rail for amorphous radiators, 615 mm downstream of the goniometer.
Data collected using these radiators are used to normalize the incoherent bremsstrahlung component from the linearly polarized beam data.

\subsubsection{Diamond Selection and Quality Control \label{sec:diamonds}}
The properties of diamond make it suitable for use as the radiator in coherent bremsstrahlung; its small lattice constant and high Debye temperature result in small thermal motion of the atoms in the lattice, and its lattice structure suffers minimal thermal effects.

Important considerations when choosing a diamond radiator are its thickness and its purity. The thickness of the radiator affects the angular divergence of the resulting photon beam, due to multiple scattering effects of the electron beam., as can impurities, which can cause defects in the crystal lattice structure \cite{YANG2010719,YANG2012}.
Minimising this divergence enhances the coherent bremsstrahlung spectrum, so the diamond used should be as thin as the considerations of manufacturing and positioning of the radiator allow.

\label{fig:beam:tagger-hall} 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Photon Tagging System \label{sec:tag}}
After passing through a radiator, the mixed photon-electron beam produced enters the photon tagging system (``tagger''), where the electrons are swept out of the beamline by a dipole magnet and detected by one of two systems in the tagger focal plane; the broadband hodoscope (TAGH) or the high resolution microscope (TAGM).
See Fig.\,\ref{fig:beam:tagger-hall}.
A permanent, 0.8~T$\cdot$m dipole magnet is located
downstream of the tagger magnet on the photon beam line, preventing
the electron beam from reaching Hall D should the tagger magnet trip.

Both the TAGM and TAGH devices are used to determine the photon beam energy via the relation $E_{\gamma} = E_{0} - E_{e}$, where $E_{0}$ is the primary electron beam energy from CEBAF, before interaction with the radiator, and $E_{e}$ is the energy of the electron determined by its detected position in the focal plane.
Electrons that did not interact with the radiator are swept into the electron beam dump.


\subsubsection{Tagger Magnet \label{sec:tagMagnet}}
The Hall D tagger magnet deflects electrons in the horizontal plane, allowing the bremsstrahlung-produced photons to continue to the experimental hall while having the electrons that produced them deposited in the focal plane detectors.
Electrons that lost a small amount of energy to bremsstrahlung in the
radiator, or did not interact with the radiator, are deflected by 13.4$^\circ$ into the electron beam dump.
Electrons that lost more than 25\% of their initial energy are deflected into the focal plane of the magnet, and are detected in either the TAGM or TAGH.

The Hall D tagger magnet is a dipole magnet 1.13 m wide, 1.41 m high and 6.3 m long, weighing 80 metric tons.
It has a normal operating field of 1.5 Tesla, with a maximum field of 1.75 T, and a pole gap of 30 mm.
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Need description of field. Summary of mapping. Uncertainty on absolute field? Uniformity? Standard operation and experience.}


\subsubsection{Tagger Microscope (TAGM)}\label{sec:TAGM}
The Tagger Microscope is a high-resolution hodoscope that counts post-bremsstrahlung electrons corresponding to the photon energy band of interest to the experiment in Hall D.
For a 12 GeV incident electron beam in the \GX{} experiment, the microscope is used to tag photons between 8.4 and 9.0 GeV, with 0.1\% energy resolution, and timing resolution of 200 ps.
This energy range changes depending on the primary electron beam energy, and the device is also designed to be movable to center on other energy ranges as demanded by experiment.

Scintillating fibre bundles are oriented towards the incoming electron axis in the tagger focal plane (Fig.~\ref{fig:TAGM_conceptual}), and read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at the other end.
This detector provides fine segmentation along the direction of the electrons' spread, increasing the energy resolution, as well as allowing selective readout to match the photon collimator acceptance through segmentation in the y-direction.

The TAGM comprises a total of 510, 2$\times$2$\times$20 mm$^3$, multi-clad Saint-Gobain BCF-20 fibers, arranged into 17 bundles of 30 fibers, with each bundle having a 5 row $\times$ 6 column formation. These bundles are spliced to BCF-98 clear fiber light guides, and read out by Hamamatsu SiPMs\footnote{Model S10931-050P} mounted on a custom built two stage preamplifier board, with flash ADC output.
The board is capable of providing readout from the individual SiPMs, as well as summing the signals over a column to provide one output for each energy bin.
To reduce the burden of cabling in the tagger hall, only four columns in the TAGH are cabled for individual readout.
These are sufficient for monitoring the alignment of the electron beam along the focal plane.

        }
\label{fig:TAGM_conceptual} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Broadband Tagging Hodoscope (TAGH)}\label{sec:TAGHIntro}
The Tagger Hodoscope is a device consisting of $\sim$220 scintillator counters distributed over a length of 9.25 m and mounted just behind the focal plane of the tagger magnet.
Its function is to provide coarse sampling of the full photon energy range from 25\% to 97\% of incident electron energy (3.0 GeV to 11.7 GeV at an electron beam energy of 12 GeV), with a gap in coverage filled by the higher-resolution tagger microscope.
This broad coverage aids in alignment of the diamond radiator and expands the \GX{} physics program reach to photon energies beyond the coherent peak alone.

Each counter in the hodoscope comprises a 6 mm thick and 40 mm high EJ-228 scintillator, of varying widths between 3 and 21 millimetres, coupled to a $\mu$-metal shielded Hamamatsu R9800 PMT via a cylindrical acrylic\footnote{UVT-PMMA} light guide 22.2 mm in diameter and 120 mm long.

The PMTs are instrumented with an active base designed at Jefferson Lab~\cite{tagh:base}. The base consists of a high-voltage divider and an amplifier powered by current flowing through the divider and provides two signal outputs for flash ADC and TDC.
The amplifier with a gain factor of 8.5 allows to operate the PMT at  a smaller voltage of 900 V and reduce the PMT anode current, therefore improving the rate capability. The maximum rate of the counter is about 4 MHz.

The counters are mounted with their faces normal to the path of the scattered electrons, in two rows, either 8 cm or 13 cm from the focal plane.
This allows the counters to be positioned without horizontal gaps in the electron beam direction, enabling complete coverage of the entire tagged photon energy range.

The construction of the hodoscope allows for later addition of counters to fully cover the energy range above the coherent peak for other microscope positions by filling the gaps between sampling scintillators. The mounting frame of the hodoscope is suspended from the Tagger-Hall ceiling to provide full flexibility of microscope positioning.

\subsection{Beam profiler}
The beam profiler is located immediately upstream of the collimator and is used to measure photon beam profiles.
The profiler consists of two planes of scintillator fibres, giving information on the photon beam profile in the X and Y directions.
Each plane is made up of 64 square fibres, 2 mm in width, read out by eight {\color{red} (Elton: 8 total or 8/side?)} multi-anode PMTs. The profilers are only used during beam setup until
the beam is centered on the active collimator and it can be used reliably to provide feedback on the beam position. They are retracted during physics production runs.
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Is there a Hall B reference for these detectors?}

\subsection{Active collimator \label{sec:coll}}
The Active Collimator monitors the photon beam position and provides fast feedback to micro-steering magnets in the electron beamline, for the purpose of suppressing drifts in beam position.
It is located in the collimator cave area, on the front face of the primary collimator, and consists of a large tungsten plate, divided into two radial rings and four quadrants. The design of the active collimator is based on a device pioneered at SLAC for monitoring their coherent bremsstrahlung beam \cite{Miller:1973yi}. 
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Short description of device; reference should help those interested in more details. Need to add position resolution (inner and outer) and stability. Add comment on operational experience with the feedback loop in place.}

When a beam photon interacts with the plates, it creates a particle shower, detected by arrays of tungsten wires mounted parallel to the beam direction on each section of the Active Collimator.
These induce currents in the plate which indicate the degree of displacement of the beam from its intended center position.

\subsection{Collimator}
The photon beam produced at the diamond radiator contains both incoherent and coherent bremsstrahlung components.
In the region of the coherent peak, where photon polarization is at its maximum, the angular spread of coherent bremsstrahlung photons is less than that of incoherent bremsstrahlung.
The coherent radiation is concentrated at small angles $<$25~$\mu$rad with respect to the beam direction, while the incoherent radiation has a broader angular distribution.
To maximise the degree of linear polarization in the photon beam, it is tightly collimated.

The Hall D primary collimator provides apertures of 3.4 mm and 5.0 mm in a tungsten plate mounted on an X-Y table, the latter of which is typically used in normal \GX{} running conditions.
The entire collimator is surrounded by lead shielding.
The device may also be positioned to block the beam to prevent high current beam, occasionally delivered by CEBAF for the purposes of beam tuning, from entering the experimental hall. Following this primary collimator, there is a sweeping magnet and a secondary cleanup collimator, magnet and 
lead shielding to remove unwanted charged particles from the photon beam. The photon beam exiting the collimation system is delivered to the systems downstream for monitoring and use in physics experiments.

\subsection{Triplet polarimeter \label{sec:tpol}}
The triplet polarimeter, or TPol, is used to measure the degree of polarization of the linearly polarized photon beam \cite{DUGGER2017115}.
The polarimeter uses the process of pair production on atomic electrons in a beryllium target foil, with these scattered atomic electrons measured using a silicon strip detector.
Information of the degree of polarization of the photon beam can be obtained by analysing the azimuthal distribution of the scattered atomic electrons measured by this device.
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Useful to add a little information on how data are taken and how much statistics is needed to determine the polarization}.

\subsection{Pair spectrometer         (Sasha) \label{sec:ps}}

The Pair Spectrometer \cite{BARBOSA2015376} is located at the entrance to Hall D.
%(Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:hall-d}).
The spectrometer reconstructs the energy of a beam photon by detecting the $e^\pm$ pair produced by the photon in a thin converter. 
Electrons and positrons are registered in two layers of scintillator
detectors: a high-granularity hodoscope and a set of coarse counters,
referred to as PS and PSC, respectively. The detectors are organized into two arms positioned symmetrically with respect to the photon beam line. The PSC consists of sixteen scintillator counters, eight in each detector arm. Each counter is 4.4 cm wide, 2 cm thick in the direction along the lepton trajectory and 6 cm heigh. The pair spectrometer hodoscope consists of 145 rectangular 
tiles (1 mm and 2 mm wide) stacked together. Light from the PSC counters is detected using Hamamatsu R6427-01 PMTs. Hamamatsu silicon photomultipliers were chosen for the instrumentation of the PS hodoscope~\cite{Barbosa:2017zzw,Somov:2017kif,Tolstukhin:2014zsa}.

Each detector arm covers a momentum range of $e^\pm$ between 3.0 GeV/c and 6.2 GeV/c, 
corresponding to reconstructed photon energies between 6~GeV and 12.4~GeV. The relatively
large acceptance of the hodoscope allows one to reconstruct photons
with energies in the coherent peak energy region and also in the range
near the beam end-point energy of 12~GeV. Some details about the performance of the spectrometer are given in~\cite{Somov:2017vhp,Somov:2016bgb}.

The main purpose of the spectrometer is to measure the spectrum of the
collimated photon beam and determine the fraction of linearly polarized
photons in the coherent peak energy region.
It is also used to monitor the photon beam flux and can be used for 
energy calibration of the tagging hodoscope and microscope detectors.
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Further description (Can refer back to Fig with photon flux and polarization) What is the timing resolution? Rate of PS triggers? What is the energy resolution? Stability of the system?}

%Electron-positron pairs are created by beam photons inside a thin
%converter with a typical thickness ranging between 0.03\% and 0.5\% of
%a radiation length. The choice of the converter thickness depends on
%the photon beam flux. The maximum photon flux for GlueX physics runs
%is expected to be 50~MHz in the coherent peak energy region. Three
%converters with different thicknesses are installed in a movable fork
%that can insert one of them into the photon beam. Produced leptons are
%deflected in a 18D36 dipole magnet with an effective field length of
%about 0.94~m. The magnet was brought from Brookhaven National
%Laboratory and was modified at Jefferson Lab by reducing the pole gap
%from 6 inches to 3 inches. The magnet is operated at a nominal field
%of 1.8~T; the field integral is $\int{}Bdl\approx$1.60~T\,m. The beam
%angular spread is $<0.04$~mrad, and the angular spread of the pair
%production is $\sim{}\gamma^{-1}<0.2$~mrad. The multiple scattering at
%3~GeV in the thickest converter adds about 0.3~mrad. The particle

%(adhesive strips) positioned between the adjacent groups. The 
%first group is tilted by about 80~mrad, so that the tiles are parallel
%the 6~GeV particle trajectories.
%
%Light from a tile is collected using two 20~cm long 2$\times$2~mm$^2$
%double-clad BCF-92 wave-length shifting (WLS) fibers,
%glued to the sides of the tile using BC 600 Optical Cement. A tile
%assembly with two WLS optical fibers is shown in
%Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-tiles}. The peak of the emission spectrum for EJ-212
%%scintillator occurs at the wavelength of 423 nm, which couples well
%with the absorption spectrum of the BCF-92 fiber. Light is
%subsequently re-emitted inside the fiber in the green range with an
%emission peak of 492 nm.
%
%Collected light is transmitted to the end of the WLS fiber. A pair of
%fibers from each tile is inserted into a hole in an aluminum mounting
%plate. %, as shown on the upper plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:hodoscope}. 
%The light detection is performed using Hamamatsu
%surface mount S10931-050P silicon photomultipliers with an effective
%photosensitive area of 3$\times$3~mm$^2$ and a pixel size of 0.05$\times$0.05~mm$^2$.
%These sensors have a photon detection efficiency (PDE) larger
%than 20\% at a wavelength of 500~nm and a typical gain of about
%$7\cdot{}10^5$~\footnote{

%  \label{sec:beamline:ps-coarse} }
%
%Sixteen coarse scintillator counters, eight in each detector arm, are
%positioned about 40~cm behind the hodoscope.  The counters are 4.4~cm
%wide in the direction perpendicular to the particle trajectory, 2~cm
%thick, and 6~cm in height.  Hamamatsu R6427-01 PMTs are used to detect
%the scintillation light. The counters are used to produce a pair
%spectrometer trigger by requiring a coincidence of hits in the two
%detector arms. They also help to reduce background originating from
%interactions of $e^\pm$ inside the magnet pole edges to the level
%below 1\% by constraining the $e^\pm$ trajectories.  Counter rates
%depend on the converter thickness and photon beam flux. The maximum
%rate will not exceed 10~kHz per PSC counter during GlueX operation.
%

%\subsubsection[Electronics]{Electronics\label{sec:beamline:ps-electronics}}
%
%The PS hodoscope front end electronics consists of an amplifier and a
%SiPM bias voltage control circuit developed at Jefferson Lab. Signals
%from the SiPMs are amplified using the amplifier with a gain of about
%a factor of 20.  The amplifier is based on commercially available
%devices (operational amplifiers) with 3~GHz bandwidth.  Pulse shaping
%is employed to compensate for the characteristically high SiPM
%capacitance and package inductance. The impulse response shows rise
%and fall times of 3~ns and with trans-impedance gain of 1~mV/$\mu$A.  
%The SiPM operating bias voltage is about 73~V. The
%nominal bias setting is as specified by Hamamatsu (1~V over voltage)
%and fed to the SiPM through a resistive network employing a thermistor
%and a linearizing resistor. The hodoscope control electronics supply
%individually adjusted voltages to groups of 5 SiPM channels; inside
%the group the voltage is adjusted among channels using resistors. The
%thermistor senses the average temperature of closely packed SiPMs in
%thermal equilibrium via a heat spreader PCB layout, thus forming a
%well controlled loop. 
%%The commercially available bias power supply has
%%very low noise characteristics and is well regulated to less than 1~mV
%%long term. The supply allows the user to monitor and adjust the levels
%%as needed and if required. The optimal bias setting will be determined
%%based on experimental conditions.
%
%Signals from both the hodoscope and coarse counters are digitized
%using a twelve-bit multi-channel flash ADC operated at a sampling rate
%of 250~MHz (fADC250-MHz). The PSC counters are also instrumented with
%TDCs, with the intrinsic resolution of $\sim$60~ps.  The timing resolution
%is expected to be better than 200~ps. 
%
%An example of the fADC signal pulse obtained from a PS scintillator
%tile is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-signals} (left).  The ADC
%sampling time is 4~ns. The SiPMs allow to resolve the number of pixels
%fired, demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam:ps-signals} (right). The
%average amplitudes of the signals in the Pair Spectrometer correspond
%to about 60 pixels fired.
%
%%This resolution will allow one
%%to distinguish the electron beam bunch where the bremsstrahlung photon
%%is emitted and therefore relate hits from the pair spectrometer and
%%tagging detectors originating from the same event.

\subsection{Total absorption counter \label{sec:tac}}
The Total Absorption Counter (TAC) is a high-efficiency lead glass calorimeter, used at low beam currents ($<5$nA) to determine the overall efficiency of the coherent bremsstrahlung facility.
The TAC was originally developed for and deployed in Hall B, for real photon beam operations with CLAS \cite{clasnote1992014, clasnote1993011, clasnote1999002}, and was transferred to Hall D to serve the same purpose for \GX{}.
Not every photon produced at the radiator reaches the hall, and in normal \GX{} running not every photon that reaches the hall causes an interaction that is seen in the \GX{} detector.

Using the TAC at normal \GX{} production currents is not possible, as it would very quickly succumb to radiation damage, therefore the TAC is used to measure photons reaching it at low currents with near 100\% efficiency.
From this measurement, the fraction of bremsstrahlung produced photons reaching \GX{} at nominal operational beam currents can be determined by extrapolation.
{\color{red} Comments by Elton: Describe how the PS measures the relative rate and the TAC is used to determine the absolute flux assuming the PS is a linear device.}

{\color{red} Comment by Stuart: TAC runs have also been performed using v-wires during GlueX phase I, and the CompCal (although the latter may count as PrimEx commissioning). Should we mention either of these?}

%Finally, the photon beam travels through the \GX{} detector, and
%ultimately goes to the photon beam dump just outside the downstream end of the experimental hall.
%The main parameters and properties of the Photon Beam are given in and \ref{tab:operates}.
%{\color{red} Comment by Stuart: Hasn't this already been stated at the beginning of this section?}
