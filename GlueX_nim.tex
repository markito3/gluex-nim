\title{The GlueX Beam Line and Detector}

\input{authors.tex}



\begin{abstract}
***DRAFT place holder***\\
The GlueX experiment was designed to study photoproduction reactions with a 9-GeV linearly polarized beam. The energy and time of beam photons are tagged using a scintillator
hodoscope and scintillating fiber array. The flux is determined using a pair spectrometer and its polarization is determined using a triplet polarimeter. 
Charged particle tracks are analyzed in solenoidal field using a central straw tube
drift chamber and six packages planar chambers with cathode strips and drift wires. Electromagnetic showers are reconstructed in a cylindrical scintillating fiber calorimeter inside the magnet and
a lead glass array downstream. Charged particle identification is achieved by measuring energy loss in the wire chambers and using the flight time of particles between the target and outside 
detectors. The signals from all detectors are recorded with flash ADCs or pipeline TDCs into memories allowing trigger decisions with a latency of 4 $\mu$s. The detector operates routinely at
trigger rates of 50 kHz. We describe the photon beam, the GlueX detector components, electronics, data-acquisition and monitoring, and the performance of the system during the first three 
years of operation.
